_Building a Modern Computer from First Principles_

In this repository I'll update my progress as I complete the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) open source courseware.

Note that I am only uploading my /projects folder. If you are interested in completing the course yourself, go to the nand2tetris website linked above and follow their instructions for setting up the development environment.
